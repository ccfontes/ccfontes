=== Hacker on a mission

Hacker on a mission at Fleck, building AI replicas to unravel authentic human connection.

=== Bootstrapper

Not a stranger to ground zero development, I have bootstrapped products like https://fleck.chat[Fleck], https://mailbriefly.com[MailBriefly], https://github.com/reusle[Reusle], Heriti, and https://github.com/kanasubs[Kanasubs].

=== Functional Programming

With over a decade of functional programming experience with Clojure, my coding focuses on practical simplicity.

I use Reagent for all my frontend work, leveraging ClojureScriptâ€™s regular functions, Hiccup syntax, and atoms to make UI logic minimal, composable, and state management intuitive.

=== Serverless

I'm experienced in designing and implementing serverless, event-driven data pipelines with AWS and OpenFaaS.

My foundation in functional programming makes it natural to build serverless architectures by composing small, stateless functions that are easy to test, scale, and maintain.

=== Developer experience

I care about developer experience, which led to projects like the https://github.com/ccfontes/eg[eg] test library and OpenFaaS templates such as https://github.com/ccfontes/faas-bb[faas-bb].

=== A world citizen

My background spans organizations of all sizes and cultures, shaped while living and working in Japan, UK, Poland, and Portugal.

I'm influenced by the work of Frederic Laloux on https://www.reinventingorganizations.com[Reinventing Organizations] to structure organizations that are sustainable at scale.

=== Empathetic and unconventional

Keen instinct for knowing when people need help very early on, preventing them from running into trouble.

I challenge norms deliberately, picking my battles where complexity or convention hides something harmful.
